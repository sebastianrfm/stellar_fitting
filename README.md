# stellar_fitting

This coding sample is written in python.  It combines stellar photomotry and stellar morphology fitting into an MCMC framework to accurate model substructures in stellar populations which cannot be seen through the telescope itself.

The code includes both the "meat" of the program and the IO files that make the often messy astrophysics data readable.
